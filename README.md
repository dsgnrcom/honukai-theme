These are CSS colors for terminal emulators that accept CSS colors in their config files like "Tabby" https://tabby.sh/
I attempted to create a "color theme file" and "theme plug-in" but saw no way to implement them in settings, so I went the CSS route.

-----
The IDE versions below have way more colors extrapolated for IDE use case.
