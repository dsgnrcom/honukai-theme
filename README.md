These are CSS colors for terminal emulators that accept CSS colors in their config files like "Tabby" https://tabby.sh/
I attempted to create a "color theme file" and "theme plug-in" but saw no way to implement them in settings, so I went the CSS route.

-----
The IDE versions below have way more colors extrapolated for IDE use case.


**__ZED Ide:__**  https://zed.dev/

Consult this link: https://zed.dev/docs/themes
Use the information regarding "Local Themes."

I've adapted the theme for VS Code Ide; consult the .zip for an installable VS Code extension.

How to use in vscode:

To install the .vsix File in Visual Studio Code:

-Open the Command Palette (Cmd + Shift + P).  
-Type Extensions: Install from VSIX... and select the downloaded .vsix file in the zip.  

To Apply the Theme:
